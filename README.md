### A Node app build environment using Express, Pug, SASS, Gulp, BrowserSync, and Nodemon

This build environment uses Nodemon to automatically refresh the browser upon saving backend changes in `app.js`, while simultaneously using Gulp and BrowserSync to automatically refresh the browser upon saving frontend changes (HTML, CSS, and JS files).
